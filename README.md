# stockexchange
Simple Angular testproject, to find a good chart component of candlestick type. I want to mark buy and shell points in the chart. I want to use the bitcoin data of the public kraken api. The first step is to display a bitcoin candlestic chart, and as second step I want to calculate the RSI(14) and display it also. It is also a learning project for me.
